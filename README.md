### Abstract

This work investigates text-to-texture synthesis using diffusion models to generate physically-based texture maps.
We aim to achieve realistic model appearances under varying lighting conditions.
A prominent solution for the task is score distillation sampling.
It allows recovering a complex texture using gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading pipeline.
However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with the widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and requires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization.
As a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion models for texture synthesis (CasTex).
In our setup, score distillation sampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box.
In particular, we were able to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit parameterization to improve the procedure.
In the experiments, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based solutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.

## Installation

Please refer to [environment.yml](environment.yml) for the complete list of dependencies. To create and activate the environment using Miniconda3, run the following commands:

```.bash
git clone https://github.com/thecrazymage/CasTex.git
cd CasTex

module load Python CUDA/12.4 gnu10
conda env create -f environment.yml -n castex
conda activate castex
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@V0.7.8" --no-build-isolation
```

## Quick Start

To generate a texture for a single object using a text prompt:
```.bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```
The generated PBR textures for stages `i` and `ii` will be saved in `logs/`.

## Benchmark on Objaverse subset

To generate textures for the Objaverse objects using the protocol from the [Text2Tex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11396) paper, run the following command from the root directory:

1) Download Blender 3.3.21:
    ```.bash
    bash scripts/download_blender.sh
    ```
    This will download and extract **Blender** to `objaverse_eval/blender-3.3.21-linux-x64`.

2) To download and process the Objaverse subset:
    ```.bash
    bash scripts/objaverse_data_processing.sh
    ```
    This script downloads the original `.glb` models from the Objaverse dataset and converts them into clean `.obj` files ready for texturing.

    **Output locations:**
    - Original files: `objaverse_eval/objaverse_data/glbs`
    - Processed meshes: `objaverse_eval/objaverse_data/obj`

3) To generate the reference images for metric (FID/KID) calculation:
    ```.bash
    bash scripts/render_gt_frames.sh
    ```
    This script renders the original (ground truth) `.glb` files from the Objaverse subset using **Blender**.
    
    **Output:** All ground truth renders will be saved in `objaverse_eval/renders/ground_truth/frames`.

    *These renders are required to compute FID and KID scores.*

4) To generate textures for the preprocessed objects:
    ```.bash
    bash scripts/run_objaverse_eval.sh
    ```
    This script launches the generation process. It is optimized for multi-GPU setups (e.g., SLURM clusters).

    **Output:** Generated textures and logs will be saved in `logs/objaverse_eval_{date}`.

    > **Verification:**
    >
    > To ensure that the all generation process completed successfully, run the sanity check on the output folder:
    > ```
    > bash scripts/sanity_check.sh -d logs/objaverse_eval_{date} -ef 1 -ed 2 -esf 6
    > ```

5) To render the textured meshes to produce images for evaluation:
    ```.bash
    bash scripts/render_frames.sh logs/objaverse_eval_{date}/ ii eval_{date}
    ```

    This script renders the textures generated in stage `ii` from `logs/objaverse_eval_{date}/` using **Blender**.

    **Output:**
    - Rendered images will be stored in `objaverse_eval/renders/eval_{date}/frames`.
    - This step also produces 360° videos for qualitative comparison in `objaverse_eval/renders/eval_{date}/mp4`.

6) To calculate FID and KID:
    ```.bash
    scripts/run_metrics.sh objaverse_eval/renders/eval_{date}/frames/
    ```
    This script compares the generated renders from `objaverse_eval/renders/eval_{date}/frames/` against the ground truth from `objaverse_eval/renders/ground_truth/frames` and outputs the FID and KID scores.
